		<h2>Last updated: 11/8/2019</h2>
		<p>Remember: If JKORA is able to kill a revival, the revival wasn't very good in the first place.</p>
		<p>Any revivals missing? Let us know in the #new-revivals channel on our <a href="https://discord.gg/EnuzsUh">Discord guild</a>.</p>

		<h1>Game Release Targets</h1>

		<ol>
			<li>BrickWorld (reason: unlikely to have any anti-cheat)</li>
			<li>Bloxalgia (reason: unlikely to have any anti-cheat)</li>
			<li>GT Reborn Again (reason: unlikely to have any anti-cheat)</li>
			<li>GoodBlox 3 (reason: unlikely to have a proper anti-cheat)</li>
			<li>RoBONK! (reason: unlikely to have a proper anti-cheat)</li>
			<li>Shituves (reason: bad management, flawed idea, won't have an anti-cheat)</li>
			<li>Project Venus (reason: bad management)</li>
		</ol>
		<h1>Not going to target</h1>
		These are the revivals that JKORA is never going to target due to other reasons or a strong probability that the revival will kill itself due to being private. Last updated: 11/4/2019

			<li>Bloxtopia (reason: private)</li>
			<li>Dynabricks (reason: private)</li>
			<li>Novetus (reason: barely alive)</li>
			<li>Roblonium (reason: barely alive)</li>
			<li>Meaxico (reason: private, basically dead)</li>
			<li>Finobe (reason: too difficult)</li>
			<li>CoolBlox (reason: too epic)</li>
		</ol>
