		<p>Remember: If JKORA is able to kill a revival, the revival wasn't very good in the first place.</p>
		<p>Any revivals missing? Let us know in the #new-revivals channel on our <a href="https://discord.gg/EnuzsUh">Discord guild</a>.</p>

		<h1>Game-release Targets</h1>
		These are revivals that JKORA will target when their client releases. Last updated: 11/3/2018
		<ol>
			<li>GoodBlox 3 (reason: bad management, not likely to have a proper anti-cheat)</lI>
		</ol>
		<h1>Not going to target</h1>
		These are the revivals that JKORA is never going to target due to other reasons or a strong probability that the revival will kill itself. Last updated: 11/3/2018
		<ol>
			<li>BrickWorld (reason: they have no idea what they're doing, can't even patch a client)</li>
			<li>Baejing (reason: private, going to kill itself)</li>
			<li>GT Reborn (reason: barely alive, going to kill itself)</li>
			<li>Novetus (reason: barely alive)</li>
			<li>Finobe (reason: they actually know what they're doing)</li>
			<li>CoolBlox (reason: too epic)</li>
		</ol>
